## Repository Structure

Each Python file in this repository corresponds to a different chapter or section in the book. The name of the file indicates the topic covered in that section.

## Example

Below is an example of a solution you can find in this repository. This is an implementation of binary search, part of our exploration on efficient searching algorithms.

```python
class CyberSearch:
    def binarySearch(self, db: list[int], target: int) -> int:
        low = 0
        high = len(db) - 1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if db[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif db[mid] < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        return -1
```
